  Provides a vSphere virtual machine data source. This can be used to get data from a virtual machine or template.
---

# vsphere\_virtual\_machine

The `vsphere_virtual_machine` data source can be used to find the UUID of an
existing virtual machine or template. Its most relevant purpose is for finding
the UUID of a template to be used as the source for cloning into a new
`vsphere_virtual_machine` resource. It also
reads the guest ID so that can be supplied as well.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "vsphere_datacenter" "datacenter" {
  name = "dc1"
}

data "vsphere_virtual_machine" "template" {
  name          = "test-vm-template"
  datacenter_id = "${data.vsphere_datacenter.datacenter.id}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the virtual machine. This can be a name or
  path.
* `datacenter_id` - (Optional) The managed object reference
  ID of the datacenter the virtual machine is located in.
  This can be omitted if the search path used in `name` is an absolute path.
  For default datacenters, use the `id` attribute from an empty
  `vsphere_datacenter` data source.
* `scsi_controller_scan_count` - (Optional) The number of SCSI controllers to
  scan for disk attributes and controller types on. Default: `1`.

~> **NOTE:** For best results, ensure that all the disks on any templates you
use with this data source reside on the primary controller, and leave this
value at the default. See the
`vsphere_virtual_machine` resource
documentation for the significance of this setting, specifically the
`additional requirements and notes for
cloning` section.

## Attribute Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The UUID of the virtual machine or template.
* `guest_id` - The guest ID of the virtual machine or template.
* `alternate_guest_name` - The alternate guest name of the virtual machine when
  guest_id is a non-specific operating system, like `otherGuest`.
* `scsi_type` - The common type of all SCSI controllers on this virtual machine.
  Will be one of `lsilogic` (LSI Logic Parallel), `lsilogic-sas` (LSI Logic
  SAS), `pvscsi` (VMware Paravirtual), `buslogic` (BusLogic), or `mixed` when
  there are multiple controller types. Only the first number of controllers
  defined by `scsi_controller_scan_count` are scanned.
* `scsi_bus_sharing` - Mode for sharing the SCSI bus. The modes are
  physicalSharing, virtualSharing, and noSharing. Only the first number of
  controllers defined by `scsi_controller_scan_count` are scanned.
* `disks` - Information about each of the disks on this virtual machine or
  template. These are sorted by bus and unit number so that they can be applied
  to a `vsphere_virtual_machine` resource in the order the resource expects
  while cloning. This is useful for discovering certain disk settings while
  performing a linked clone, as all settings that are output by this data
  source must be the same on the destination virtual machine as the source.
  Only the first number of controllers defined by `scsi_controller_scan_count`
  are scanned for disks. The sub-attributes are:
 * `size` - The size of the disk, in GIB.
 * `eagerly_scrub` - Set to `true` if the disk has been eager zeroed.
 * `thin_provisioned` - Set to `true` if the disk has been thin provisioned.
* `network_interface_types` - The network interface types for each network
  interface found on the virtual machine, in device bus order. Will be one of
  `e1000`, `e1000e`, `pcnet32`, `sriov`, `vmxnet2`, or `vmxnet3`.
* `firmware` - The firmware type for this virtual machine. Can be `bios` or `efi`.
* `guest_ip_addresses` - A list of IP addresses as reported by VMWare tools.

~> **NOTE:** Keep in mind when using the results of `scsi_type` and
`network_interface_types`, that the `vsphere_virtual_machine` resource only
supports a subset of the types returned from this data source. See the
resource docs for more details.
